# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Framework

This repository provides a framework for training, evaluating, and visualizing machine learning and deep learning models. It includes modular code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically loads and preprocesses image datasets using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`.
- **Model Training**: A customizable CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Evaluation**: Includes functions to generate classification reports and confusion matrices.
- **Visualization**: Plots training and validation accuracy/loss to monitor performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
